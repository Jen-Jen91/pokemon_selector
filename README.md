# Pokemon

This React web app makes two API requests: one to GET the list of 151 original Pokemon (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151), and one to GET the details for each selected Pokemon (e.g. https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/).

Users can select a Pokemon from the dropdown menu to display their basic info, type, and available moves, along with their sprite. The app was written in JavaScript with HTML and CSS.


### To run the app:

* In the terminal, run the following commands:
    1) *npm install* 
    2) *npm start*
